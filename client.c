**
** @line 2-9		First it checks if the command line parameters given by the
** 					user are correct: 
** 					[./client <PID_SERVER> <STR_TO_SEND_TO_SERVER>]. In case
** 					this parameters are not what client needs to correctly 
** 					function, an error message is displayed and the program
** 					exits with EXIT_FAILURE.
**
** @line 10-11		if the parameters given by the user are correct, the program
** 					continues running and prepares itself to receive either
** 					SIGUSR1 - in case everything is working acordingly in server
** 					or SIGUSR2 - in case of errors from server. The signal()
** 					function is used here with the handler_sigusr() function
** 					being called once these signals are received.
**
** @line 12			after the signal() functions are all set, the program sends
** 					the first bit of 'STR_TO_SEND_TO_SERVER' to server using the 
** 					send_bit() function with the parameters argv[1] - PID, and
** 					argv[2] - message. This is the only time in the program
** 					where send_bit() is called with non null parameters. This
** 					only happens because of its static variables.
** 						**see comments on line 52-65**
**
** @line 13-14		after sending the first bit of the message, and therefore
** 					making the first contact with server, client enters an
** 					infinite loop of pause() functions waiting for either
** 					SIGUSR1 or SIGUSR2. If all goes well and the message is
** 					successfully delivered, client will only receive SIGUSR1
** 					signals from server. These signals are the acknowledgement
** 					from server that it received a bit from client. I chose this
** 					aproach instead of using the sleep() or usleep() functions.
